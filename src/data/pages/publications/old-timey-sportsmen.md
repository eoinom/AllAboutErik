mainTextTop: In the first years of the 20th century, newly mobile American
  travelers, hunters, and fisherman headed out by horseback, buggy, car, and
  boat. Their destination? The Great Outdoors! Whether in the photo studio or
  out with their new “Brownie” cameras, successful hunters and fishers posed
  proudly with their catches, sending their photographic postcards, then called
  “postals,” back home through the US Mail.  Separated by vast distances, before
  the advent of the telephone, friends and family were naturally excited to
  receive a note and photo sent from afar.  In 1907 an estimated 656 million
  cards were sent in the United States alone!
mainTextBottom: Old-Timey Sportsmen contains a gallery of uniquely American
  historical photos that take us back a century ago, when these wonderful images
  were captured and preserved for posterity.  Also included are personal,
  hand-written messages. You will love this collection of photographic images,
  each bearing witness to memorable moments in the lives of these early 20th
  century outdoorsmen and women.
