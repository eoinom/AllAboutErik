mainTextTop: Indian societies incorporated animals and animal imagery into
  ceremony and costume, ritual space and experience, social life and economy.
  Animals have shaped Andean peoples' vision of themselves, and of their shamans
  and rulers. They signified prestige, spiritual power, and contact with the
  supernatural. Animals also figured prominently among the constellations of the
  southern sky, as characters in myth and folklore, and in acts of divination
  and sacrifice. These connections forge the most vivid metaphors and icons of
  Andean ritual and art. Animal myth and magic explores the central place and
  significance of animals in the Andean cosmovision through the prism of South
  American archaeology, anthropology, natural history and mythology.
mainTextBottom: "Illustrated with 155 marvellous images from pre-Columbian
  textiles, this unique anthology discusses over forty-five species, from the
  hummingbird and butterfly to the llama and jaguar. The depictions - from
  surreal to naturalistic, are awe-provoking to whimsical, abstract to totemic -
  span a diversity of habitats and 2000 years of culture (Chavin to Inka). Key
  themes emerge: the feline, bird and snake shamanic archetypes; a fascination
  with magical transformation; a pre-occupation with water and fertility in the
  arid, fragile ecologies of the desert and high sierra; and an intricate visual
  code based on the signs of the fang, claw, spotted pelt, whisker and wing. The
  compelling information, the extraordinary inventiveness and variety of
  mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and insects represented in the textile art,
  provide an outstanding source of reference for all readers intrigued by animal
  symbolism, Native American art, and the vitality and creativity of the
  pre-Colombian imagination."
