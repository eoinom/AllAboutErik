My dad grew up in Norway and took me fishing at an early age at our country club. I got the bug and just never stopped. In the Midwest we fished in lakes, rivers, and ponds for bluegills, sunfish, bullheads, perch, bass, pike, and carp.  As a teenager I loved going to Florida to fish in the saltwater. Later I started going to Mexico and I’ve been to Baja fishing 50 times. My buddy Mike and I have shared a Boston Whaler for a half century. We do San Francisco Bay and the ocean for salmon, halibut, stripers, and sturgeon. I enjoy being out on the water. I love catching and eating fish. It’s been a lifelong passion.
