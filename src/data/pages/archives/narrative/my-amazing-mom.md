        Both had immigrated from Norway in 1906, when each was only 16 years
        old, and they met each other in Chicago. Both had come from the same
        little town back home. Marianne's mom had died giving birth to her, and
        Dietrich was the youngest son of Ole Pedersen, who had six kids with his
        first wife, who then died, and had six more with his second. Dietrich
        and Marianne had five kids together, the youngest of which was my mom.
        The family moved to Oak Park Illinois in 1916. My mom lived there for
        the rest of her life. She loved Oak Park.

      text: On behalf of her love for Oak Park, the next decades saw her build a dizzying portfolio of supporting causes and involvement in civic life. She joined the Oak Park League and served as its president. She worked on the district school board for six years and served as the president there as well. My mom was on the high school Board of Education. Elsie started a beautification Commission and served as chairperson, planting trees and flower gardens all over town. She started local block parties, so neighbours could get to know each other, and feel a sense of belonging to the community. Mom started the Oak Park Historical Society, and as its driving force, it fell in her bailiwick in ’73 to have the first Saturday night drink served in Oak Park after it had been dry for 107 years.

It had fallen into disrepair and was slated to be demolished and replaced by a parking lot. Mom couldn't let that happen. She started the “Save the Conservatory” committee in 1970, and as was typical of her approach and style, she took botany and horticulture classes to be able to speak knowledgeably about the plant collection. The conservatory was expanded in 2000. Today it houses 3000 plants, some dating all the way back to 1914.

When my mom heard Frank Lloyd Wright's old home had been sold, and the new owner planed extensive remodeling, she swung into action. She organized a committee and raised the money to save the house. The home and studio are now a National Historic landmark. Elsie was instrumental in the founding of the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust and helped pioneer and promote walks and visits to local homes built by Wright. Last year 65,000 people walked this Frank Lloyd Wright trail. The trust also raised the money to restore the famous Unity Temple. She was personal friends with the architect’s son Eric Wright.

      text: The longest project my mom took part in, was her work with the Oak Park Council of International Affairs. She started a program called “School to School”. She traveled to Washington DC and had a meeting with Sargent Shriver in ‘63 or ‘64 asking him how Oak Park could contribute to the Peace Corps and the United Nations. He suggested she get Oak Park schools involved with a program by which money could be raised, and schools built in third world countries worldwide. The concept called for money coming from three sources. One third from the local people who would build the school, one third from the US government on behalf of the Peace Corps, and the final third raised from contributions from local schools in Oak Park.

      text: The process involved my mom contacting Peace Corps volunteers working around the world, and asking them if they knew any local villages in the areas where they worked who might be interested in taking part in a project to erect their own school. If one of the volunteers had an idea and wanted to be involved, my mom would ask them to take pictures of the place, and on their next trip back to the states come to Oak Park and appear with my mom at a local Oak Park school assemblies to solicit contributions for the building program.

      text: They would give their presentation promising that the students would be kept abreast of the construction of the school and become pen pals with the kids that lived there. My mom was a very persuasive salesperson, and although it involved a great deal of time and effort, the program was a great success with local kids. Over the years they built school after school. At the time she retired from the effort, many years later, she had been instrumental in building over 300 schools in 90 different third world countries. My mom, sister, and I attended a wonderful ceremony dedicating one of her schools to her late husband, my dad, in Esmeralda, Guatemala. It was a heartwarming occasion with the entire village, mostly Indians, turning out for the dedication of their new school. Elsie did a short write up about the visit.

        Both had immigrated from Norway in 1906, when each was only 16 years
        old, and they met each other in Chicago. Both had come from the same
        little town back home. Marianne's mom had died giving birth to her, and
        Dietrich was the youngest son of Ole Pedersen, who had six kids with his
        first wife, who then died, and had six more with his second. Dietrich
        and Marianne had five kids together, the youngest of which was my mom.
        The family moved to Oak Park Illinois in 1916. My mom lived there for
        the rest of her life. She loved Oak Park.

Her mom suggested she go with Doctor Jacobsen and with some reluctance she agreed. Apparently, they hit it off big time, because they began dating.

        Both had immigrated from Norway in 1906, when each was only 16 years
        old, and they met each other in Chicago. Both had come from the same
        little town back home. Marianne's mom had died giving birth to her, and
        Dietrich was the youngest son of Ole Pedersen, who had six kids with his
        first wife, who then died, and had six more with his second. Dietrich
        and Marianne had five kids together, the youngest of which was my mom.
        The family moved to Oak Park Illinois in 1916. My mom lived there for
        the rest of her life. She loved Oak Park.

She joined the Oak Park League and served as its president. She worked on the district school board for six years and served as the president there as well. My mom was on the high school Board of Education. Elsie started a beautification Commission and served as chairperson, planting trees and flower gardens all over town. She started local block parties, so neighbours could get to know each other, and feel a sense of belonging to the community. Mom started the Oak Park Historical Society, and as its driving force, it fell in her bailiwick in ’73 to have the first Saturday night drink served in Oak Park after it had been dry for 107 years.

It had fallen into disrepair and was slated to be demolished and replaced by a parking lot. Mom couldn't let that happen. She started the “Save the Conservatory” committee in 1970, and as was typical of her approach and style, she took botany and horticulture classes to be able to speak knowledgeably about the plant collection. The conservatory was expanded in 2000. Today it houses 3000 plants, some dating all the way back to 1914.

      text: Frank Lloyd Wright and Ernest Hemingway were two of Oak park's most notable former residents. When my mom heard Frank Lloyd Wright's old home had been sold, and the new owner planed extensive remodeling, she swung into action. She organized a committee and raised the money to save the house. The home and studio are now a National Historic landmark. Elsie was instrumental in the founding of the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust and helped pioneer and promote walks and visits to local homes built by Wright. Last year 65,000 people walked this Frank Lloyd Wright trail. The trust also raised the money to restore the famous Unity Temple. She was personal friends with the architect’s son Eric Wright.

      text: The longest project my mom took part in, was her work with the Oak Park Council of International Affairs. She started a program called “School to School”. She traveled to Washington DC and had a meeting with Sargent Shriver in ‘63 or ‘64 asking him how Oak Park could contribute to the Peace Corps and the United Nations. He suggested she get Oak Park schools involved with a program by which money could be raised, and schools built in third world countries worldwide. The concept called for money coming from three sources. One third from the local people who would build the school, one third from the US government on behalf of the Peace Corps, and the final third raised from contributions from local schools in Oak Park.

My mom was a very persuasive salesperson, and although it involved a great deal of time and effort, the program was a great success with local kids. Over the years they built school after school. At the time she retired from the effort, many years later, she had been instrumental in building over 300 schools in 90 different third world countries. My mom, sister, and I attended a wonderful ceremony dedicating one of her schools to her late husband, my dad, in Esmeralda, Guatemala. It was a heartwarming occasion with the entire village, mostly Indians, turning out for the dedication of their new school. Elsie did a short write up about the visit.

      text: On behalf of her love for Oak Park, the next decades saw her build a dizzying portfolio of supporting causes and involvement in civic life. She joined the Oak Park League and served as its president. She worked on the district school board for six years and served as the president there as well. My mom was on the high school Board of Education. Elsie started a beautification Commission and served as chairperson, planting trees and flower gardens all over town. She started local block parties, so neighbours could get to know each other, and feel a sense of belonging to the community. Mom started the Oak Park Historical Society, and as its driving force, it fell in her bailiwick in ’73 to have the first Saturday night drink served in Oak Park after it had been dry for 107 years.

It had fallen into disrepair and was slated to be demolished and replaced by a parking lot. Mom couldn't let that happen. She started the “Save the Conservatory” committee in 1970, and as was typical of her approach and style, she took botany and horticulture classes to be able to speak knowledgeably about the plant collection. The conservatory was expanded in 2000. Today it houses 3000 plants, some dating all the way back to 1914.

      text: Frank Lloyd Wright and Ernest Hemingway were two of Oak park's most notable former residents. When my mom heard Frank Lloyd Wright's old home had been sold, and the new owner planed extensive remodeling, she swung into action. She organized a committee and raised the money to save the house. The home and studio are now a National Historic landmark. Elsie was instrumental in the founding of the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust and helped pioneer and promote walks and visits to local homes built by Wright. Last year 65,000 people walked this Frank Lloyd Wright trail. The trust also raised the money to restore the famous Unity Temple. She was personal friends with the architect’s son Eric Wright.

      text: The longest project my mom took part in, was her work with the Oak Park Council of International Affairs. She started a program called “School to School”. She traveled to Washington DC and had a meeting with Sargent Shriver in ‘63 or ‘64 asking him how Oak Park could contribute to the Peace Corps and the United Nations. He suggested she get Oak Park schools involved with a program by which money could be raised, and schools built in third world countries worldwide. The concept called for money coming from three sources. One third from the local people who would build the school, one third from the US government on behalf of the Peace Corps, and the final third raised from contributions from local schools in Oak Park.

If one of the volunteers had an idea and wanted to be involved, my mom would ask them to take pictures of the place, and on their next trip back to the states come to Oak Park and appear with my mom at a local Oak Park school assemblies to solicit contributions for the building program.

      text: They would give their presentation promising that the students would be kept abreast of the construction of the school and become pen pals with the kids that lived there. My mom was a very persuasive salesperson, and although it involved a great deal of time and effort, the program was a great success with local kids. Over the years they built school after school. At the time she retired from the effort, many years later, she had been instrumental in building over 300 schools in 90 different third world countries. My mom, sister, and I attended a wonderful ceremony dedicating one of her schools to her late husband, my dad, in Esmeralda, Guatemala. It was a heartwarming occasion with the entire village, mostly Indians, turning out for the dedication of their new school. Elsie did a short write up about the visit.
