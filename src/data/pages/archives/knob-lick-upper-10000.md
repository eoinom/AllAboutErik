My mom helped think up the crazy name “The Knoblick Upper 10,000”. I had started playing banjo in college at Oberlin. After graduation I decided to go professional. Dwain Story, a classmate from Oberlin, would sing lead. A young man from Chicago named Stu Ramsey joined us on dobro and we went to NYC together. But Stu got queered by an old blues guy, got totally spooked, and fled back to Chicago. Peter Childs joined up with us. Albert Grossman signed us to a management contract. We got a deal with Mercury Records and put out two LP’s. Quincy Jones was our A & R guy. We traveled all over the country. When I heard the Beatles, I quit the banjo and went back to NYC to try to produce records using folk instrumentation and electric bass and drums.
