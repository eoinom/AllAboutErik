One night my group, The Knoblick Upper 10,000, shared a bill at the Gaslight Café on McDougal Street with a fellow named Phil Ochs. He talked fast, and he was smart and funny. He was singing his own material and most of his songs were of a political protest bent. I liked him and proposed a drink after the show. We went to a little place on Bleecker Street, and we talked and drank. He was going to make an album for Elecktra Records and had total confidence that it would sell a million copies. I felt compelled to bet him a million dollar that it wouldn’t. Fifteen years later into our friendship, I reminded him he owed me the million, but he wormed out of the deal on the grounds that we hadn’t set a deadline and that the album could still possibly sell a million. It hasn’t till this day. 



Phil and I became great pals and got together every chance we could. We did a gig together in Fort Lauderdale for two weeks. In the morning, I picked banjo and lifted weights. Phil played his guitar and wrote songs. He got a telegram from New York City and was so excited thinking it was good news from his record company but I correctly predicted he had gotten his girlfriend Alice pregnant. I had become friends with Alice and when she went into labor I was there and took her uptown in a taxi, helped her check into the hospital, and wished her good luck. Their daughter Megan was born the next day. Phil was out on the road doing his thing as a protesting troubadour. 



I hung out with the three of them many days in the ensuing years in their apartment on Bleecker Street. Later in his life, Phil loved me to recount those early days in Fort Lauderdale, when he worked on his songwriting first thing every morning.



He went to Africa to sing his songs for the indigenous people but was mugged and beaten up. I think they stole his guitar. 



He was drinking more and more. One night in a bar he threw down 22 shots while we talked. He visited me on my houseboat one day with a quart of orange juice and a fifth of something. He poured out half the juice and put in the booze, drinking the whole thing in one afternoon. Blind drunk one night he got in a head-on car collision in Hollywood. No criminal charges were ever filed; the other driver was equally as loaded! Afterward, he told how he recalled spiting a lot of stuff out of his mouth after the accident. His teeth! He got a set of new dentures but after that, he had a little whistle when he talked. 



Each time we met he seemed to be drifting a little further out. He was arrested in Las Vegas and swore he spent the night in a cell with Bobby Kennedy. Calling himself John Train, he wanted me to help him produce an epic concert in Machu Picchu in conjunction with his new company that he called Barricade Ltd. Below, you can see the notes he sketched out for me on his proposal. 



At his concert at Carnegie Hall, the first show was canceled midway due to a bomb threat and the audience had to leave the theater. Later when he went back to do the second set, people were milling around outside that had seen the truncated show earlier, and Phil felt they should be allowed to see the second show because they had paid the ticket price. But the ticket booth denied his demand. He lost his temper and put his fist through the glass, cutting his finger badly, and was barely able to struggle through the second set. But he was proud of his decisive bold actions in smashing the glass. It was worrying. 



I heard later he was going to do a concert in New York City but wandered around barefoot for several days unable to find the venue. Manic depression, now called Bipolar Disorder, ran in the family. He hung himself shortly thereafter. 



What a tragic end for my wonderful and talented buddy.
