I met Normie at open mic night at the Troubadour in Hollywood. He sang a song called “School for Sweet Talk.” Nice melody and cute words. We talked backstage and he said he had a lot more songs.  I went over to his little pad behind a house in the Hollywood flats west of Melrose. One song I remember was called, “How Lou Sin Ate,” about a Chinese fellow who took acid. 



Norman had had a jug band back in '65, called “Dr. Wests Medicine Show and Junk Band”. He took acid, painted his face, and they scored a hit with his song “The Eggplant That Ate Chicago.” He was an early musician aficionado of psychedelics. 



I suggested we work together and invited him up to San Francisco. He came and we worked up arrangements for some of his tunes. We went into the studio to record. Among the sides we cut was one called “Spirit in the Sky”. Released by Warners, the record went on to become a huge worldwide hit, thanks in large part to the efforts of a single promo man at Warners, and a single radio station, KRLA. 



But the album didn’t sell that well. I think people hoped all the songs had industrial fuzz tone and sounded more like “Spirit.” So Normie took his royalties and moved to Petaluma, and a little later bought a farm up there. He started raising chickens and goats and a little later, went into business driving a route around the bay area with deliveries of fresh goat milk. 



We kept recording. Our second album, “Back Home Again”, didn’t sell, and our third album, called “Petaluma” a jug band sounding project with songs about Petaluma and his farm, suffered the same fate. But it became the biggest selling record in the history of Petaluma! And it sure had a beautifully elaborate album package! 



He had gotten married to a gal named Vicky, and they had a daughter and a son. But sadly, as can happen, his relationships with his wife faltered, and they divorced. She got the farm. She had joined up with a guru that collected Rolls Royce’s, and as a loyal follower, I think she bought him one. 



So Normie quickly went from kind of well-heeled to not well-heeled at all. He moved south for a while and then came back north. When “Spirit” was embraced by the baby boomer and nostalgia wave, Normie got flush again. He quit his job at the restaurant where he had been employed. In time our record went totally iconic. We had a lot of fun discussing the latest uses and covers. It went number one in England three separate times. Normies version, then one by Doctor and the Medics, and then another by Gareth Gates. There were movie uses, ads, and TV shows. 



Later, on the scary side, Norman was in the suicide seat when the car he as in was hit broadside by a motorcyclist. He suffered a broken everything and lingered near death for several weeks. It’s been a long road back from that, but I’m glad to report he’s almost as good as new. 



What a sweet guy, cool partner, and friend he’s been to me.
