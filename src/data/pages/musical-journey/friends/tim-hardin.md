In '64 I was looking for artists to sing on my embarrassing and ill-fated attempt to start my own dance craze. A singing duo there in the village called Two Guys from Boston told me about a singer up there named Tim Hardin. I called him and agreed to send him some bucks to come down and audition. We met in the Dugout, a bar on Bleecker Street next to the Bitter End. We had a drink and talked. The conversation soon turned to drugs, and he asked me if I had any shit, or knew where to get some. Naively I thought he meant pot. But not so. It turned out his tastes also ran toward harder stuff. 



But he came over and sang for me at my apartment on Prince Street. The minute I heard his voice, all thoughts of him participating in my “dance craze” project immediately evaporated. He had a fabulous voice, wasn’t recording, and so I proposed we try to cut some demos together. He was singing blues songs.  He agreed to give the recording a try. So we made a little demo of a few songs. Playing it in the next few days, a neighbor from across the hall knocked on my door, introduced himself and asked, “who’s that singing?” It turned out to be John Sebastian. We talked and I told John I planned to record Tim, and he volunteered to play harmonica on the record. When I heard John play a little bit, I readily agreed. So Tim, John and I began to plan our recording. Our friend Felix Pappalardi suggested we use Sticks Evans on drums and Bob Bushnel on bass. Tim was not a happy go lucky type of guy even when he felt good. To get a smile out of him was a rare event, but I booked the musicians and the studio, and we went in to record at Allegro Sound Studios, a small place in mid-town. The owner was also the engineer. A friend of Tim’s named Pampa came to the session and wandered between the control room and the outside office. We recorded for hours and it went well. Tim went to the bathroom and got high. We finally finished and when we went out into the front office, we were in for a shock. Pampa was gone along with every single thing that hadn’t been nailed down in the office. It turned out he was a clepto. Even the signs from the restroom doors were gone, along with the typewriter, the files, the chairs, and even the Rolodex! The studio owner was beyond pissed. That cost me hundreds extra, but the recording sounded great. 



I brought it around to record companies but only one, Columbia, was willing to give him a chance at a contract. They wanted to do a test session so we went over to the Columbia studio. John was there, and Zal and Cass came to listen as well. I can’t remember the players, but after they got set up, Tim went to the bathroom, came back and sat down, strummed a few cords, and just nodded out. The Columbia guy didn’t know what was up but he didn’t like it and called the session. So much for Columbia. Since no one else was interested, that was that for the time being. 



Money being a great motivator for Tim, I came up with the idea of offering him 50 bucks for every song he wrote with two verses and a chorus. He went back to Boston to write songs. Several months later, he called and said the writing had been going well, and when he came down and I heard the songs, I got very excited. We decided to go into business together, me as his publisher, producer, and nominal manager. I had moved to 97 MacDougal and Tim often came by to shoot upon his way to gigs at the Night Owl. 



I borrowed several thousand dollars from my parents, and Tim and I began work on an album of his new songs. We used a variety of musicians and recorded in several different studios. It wasn’t easy. Timmy wasn’t strong in the dependability department, not as concerned his arrival times or his ability to sing and play. Sometimes he never showed at all. I became a splicing expert, trying to get the tapes to sound like we knew what we were doing. His addiction to junk became more and more problematic. We went to the first methadone clinic that opened in Manhattan. It was a try but it proved futile. 



Tim could occasionally be funny. A favorite trick of his, when opening a door, was to bang it into his foot but pretend it was his face, and fall backward in feigned pain. Once when Henry and I scored a quarter pound of weed and were crazily putting it through a strainer, Timmy came by on his way to the Night Owl, and when he saw our pile of reefer he asked for some. I stuffed a big handful into an envelope, wanting to be generous, but he looked down at the envelope with a look of disappointment. I asked him, "Not enough?" He said, “Would you like to see how much I would give you if it was mine?” What could I say? He stuffed the envelope so full he couldn’t seal it. I met several of the girlfriends that he shacked up with briefly. A few of the gals told me jewelry was missing along with Tim. 



I got a call from an old friend in Chicago, a night club owner, and he wanted to book Tim. I sent him out there. He got to the club ok and told the owner and he needed some better clothes to perform in. The owner sent him down the street and called the shop keeper and told him to let Tim charge some clothes. Tim picked out as many expensive items as he could. He took the clothes and traded them to someone for smack. He checked in to a flophouse and shot himself up for three days straight. He never went back to the club. My poor mom had to find the flea bag hotel and bring him a couple hundred bucks so he could make it back to New York. 



When it was finished, the album sounded great. I couldn’t find Tim, so I wrote the liner notes in his absence, and when he saw them he was pissed. I had written things he told me, but it turned out it was filled with some shit he just made up. When no company wanted our record, Tim, always on the hunt for bucks, found some R&B record guys who put him up in a hotel and supplied him with a steady stream of dope. Several weeks later he came to the door with a scary giant black man named Archie Green. They had a handful of contracts, releases from all the agreements Tim and I had made together. It was an intimidating situation in the extreme. I wheedled my way out by asking for an amendment that would say if they sold any records or songs they would pay me back the money I had spent in advances and recording costs. They left and thankfully I never heard about that again. 



Tim told me he agreed to carry some weight of drugs from one place to another in Harlem. But people were on his trail and he claimed he had to jump from tenement roof to roof in the dark of night to escape his pursuers. Soon after that, he got on a bus for California to escape the NY scene and get clean. He later told me his sexual libido had been so tamped down by his longtime use of narcotics, that while he was going cold turkey on the bus trip across the country, he had an erection the entire way.



Out in California, he was hanging at Lenny Bruce’s pad. He played me some great new songs and collected his 50 dollars per. We went to a place in the Hollywood hills where he and a drummer planned to play me another new song. They took out the shit, a spoon, the works and shot up together right in front of me. That was the first time I heard, “If I Were a Carpenter.” We made a demo of that soon after as well as some other great new compositions. I was traveling but was still based in New York City, working hard in the studio. The Spoonful were making hits and I wasn’t desperately scuffling on the street anymore. As much belief as I had in the new songs and his singing, having to deal with such a sick and unpleasant guy was taking a toll on me. He emitted dark and dreadful vibrations. I decided to resign. 



Later I went to see him at the Whiskey in LA, he didn’t want to see me. He claimed I had told people he was a junkie! Say what?



Last time I saw him was some years later. I was visiting Jerry Yester in the studio, and as we talked a fat old bald guy that had been sitting there got up and walked out. We hadn’t even been introduced. Jerry said, “You didn’t even say hi to Timmy.” I said, “That was Tim?” I couldn’t even recognize him.
