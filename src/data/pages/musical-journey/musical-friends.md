      My friendship with Henry started when we met as fellow banjo players at a
      rehearsal for a tour we were going out on called the Traveling Hootenanny.
      His group was the Modern Folk Quartet, MFQ for short, and mine was the
      Knoblick Upper 10,000. It was a long and brutal 40-day bus trip.

      I first met Dan when I got involved with the Charlatans back in 1965. As a
      vocalist, he sang kind of flat in those days but was writing some great
      songs. His singing kept improving, and when the Charlatans split up, Dan
      started up with his own group, Dan Hicks and the Hot Licks. We were
      friends, and I was a fan and enjoyed watching the group perform. From the
      initial incarnation of the group, they were great!

      Finding Chris was a lucky break for me. I was looking for someone with
      real star potential, and when I first went to see his band I was
      impressed. I was surprised to hear them playing rockabilly sounding
      material. They had some originals and did some covers. Chris looked great,
      and he was giving the performance his all.

      I first met Zally on the road when the Knoblick Upper 10,000 played on the
      same bill as the Halifax 3. Zal was working as an accompanist for their
      group. You had the love the guy right away. He was zany, smart, fast, and
      funny.

      After I moved back to The Village to stay I started making records,
      including a demo from a singer I brought down from Boston named Tim
      Hardin. One day I was playing the demo when a next-door neighbor from
      across the hall on the 4th-floor walk-up apartment I had rented on Prince
      Street came over and knocked on the door. He introduced himself as John
      Sebastian.

      I met Normie at open mic night at the Troubadour in Hollywood. He sang a
      song called “School for Sweet Talk.” Nice melody and cute words. We talked
      backstage and he said he had a lot more songs.

      One day Rita Abrams, a pretty gal I had previously met socially,
      approached me in a restaurant, said hi, and asked me if I would please to
      listen to a tape of a song she had written about Mill Valley, our
      hometown. She claimed that in high school she only had three albums, the
      Knoblick Upper 10,000, the Lovin Spoonful, and Tim Hardin. She obviously
      had very good taste.

      A guy walked into my office on Kearny Street, claiming to be a songwriter.
      I agreed to listen to a few of his songs, and after I did he asked me what
      I thought. He listened but seemed somewhat skeptical and left saying he
      would think about my comments. Surprisingly, he called the very next day
      and said he’d done rewrites on the songs and would I listen again?

      One night my group, The Knoblick Upper 10,000, shared a bill at the
      Gaslight Café on McDougal Street with a fellow named Phil Ochs. He talked
      fast, and he was smart and funny. He was singing his own material and most
      of his songs were of a political protest bent. I liked him and proposed a
      drink after the show.

      In '64 I was looking for artists to sing on my embarrassing and ill-fated
      attempt to start my own dance craze. A singing duo there in the village
      called Two Guys from Boston told me about a singer up there named Tim
      Hardin. I called him and agreed to send him some bucks to come down and
      audition. We had a drink and talked. The conversation soon turned to
      drugs, and he asked me if I had any shit, or knew where to get some.
      Naively I thought he meant pot. But not so. It turned out his tastes also
      ran toward harder stuff.

      Jimmy was playing with Chris in the band Silvertone when I first met him.
      He previously played with the San Francisco group the Avengers. He was a
      unique and talented guitar stylist, experimenting with sounds, as well as
      using effects and techniques that harkened back to the 1950s. He was a
      sweet and soft-spoken individual, rarely bubbling over with conversation.
      In the course of the years of recording with Chris, we became good
      friends.

      Phillips, who took me to see a group called “Rhythm and Noise,” and quite
      possibly I first met Nick there in that context.

      A guy called me from Mississippi and asked if I’d listen to his group.
      They called themselves the Wallabies. I said, sure, send me a tape of your
      three best songs. The tape was ok, but he had his heart set on the band
      coming out to California to play live for me. I couldn’t dissuade him, and
      three days later he and the group showed up. They auditioned for me at our
      Sausalito heliport rehearsal hall.

      Kevin was an intense little man that came by my office in the mid-70s. He
      was a songwriter and musician but had a lot of outside projects going on
      as well. In one of our first conversations, he offered me a little black
      box that would allow me to call anyone in the world and talk as long as I
      wanted. You only had to hold it next to a phone and put in certain codes
      to make it work, but it was too complicated for me.

      Brian and I were looking for new singers after we had the big success with
      “Papa,” Nadia Finkelstein came and auditioned for us and we liked both her
      voice and her personality. Very smart, pretty, and a good sense of humor.
      We cut quite a few sides together that we thought came out well.

      Cass was a big, beautiful gal, sunny and funny with a wonderful voice. We

      playing banjo with my group. When I started trying to make records I had
      recorded various cuts with Cass, Zal, and Denny Doherty. Cass was
      hilarious, with a special sense of humor.
