    <p>In the first years of the 20th century, newly mobile American travellers,
    hunters, and fishermen headed out by horseback, buggy, car and boat. Their
    destination? The great outdoors!</p> <p></p> <p>Whether back in the photo
    studio, or in the field with their new “Brownie” cameras, successful
    sportsmen posed proudly with their catch, sending their pictures home
    through the U.S. mail, via photo postcards, then called “postals.” Separated
    by vast distances, in those days before the advent of the telephone, friends
    and family alike were naturally excited to send or receive a card with a
    message and photo sent from afar.</p> <p></p> <p>When George Eastman
    produced his first “Brownie” camera in 1900, no one could have foreseen the
    incredible popularity and success the new product would quickly achieve!
    Eastman’s vision was to put photography into the hands of the common
    man.</p> <p></p> <p>And he did!</p>
  textPt2: >-
    <p>Older cameras were bulky, unwieldy and difficult to use. But when people
    got their hands on the light and versatile Brownie, a new era was born -
    that of the “snapshot” and the “shutterbug.”</p> <p></p> <p>Although the
    controlled environment of the photo studio remained an important element in
    portraiture, and is well represented in this collection, the amateur
    photographer had suddenly been set free.</p> <p></p>    
  textPt3: >-
    <p>And when, on Mar. 1st, 1907, it became legal for the first time in the
    United States to write a note on the back of a picture postcard, floodgates
    opened, and an estimated 650 million were sent in the U.S. by year's
    end!</p> <p></p> <p>By the 20’s however, the golden age of the photo
    postcard was slowly drawing to a close.</p> <p></p> <p>Please enjoy browsing
    this archive of photographic images, each bearing witness to exciting and
    memorable moments in the lives of these early American outdoorsmen and
    women.</p>

  text: >-
    <p>In 2001, I attended a fan fair in Los Angeles featuring vintage
    television and movies stars signing autographs for long lines of nostalgic
    fans. Off the main room there was a paper ephemera show in progress, with
    old newspapers, posters and postcards for sale. As I browsed through a box
    of old pictures postcards I came across a section devoted to fishing and
    fishermen. As a lifelong angler and collecting enthusiast, the century old
    images and the accompanying message intrigued and fascinated me. I was
    hooked then and there.</p> <p></p> <p>In subsequent years, the collection
    has benefited greatly from the assistance and keen eye of my oldest son
    Jakob Dulisse, who combed the Internet relentlessly for new and exciting
    material.</p> <p></p> <p>-Erik Jacobsen</p>
